# SaveUp - Deployment Ready

## White Screen Issue - RESOLVED

### Root Cause
The white screen occurred because Replit deployment was still using the development Vite server instead of serving production HTML.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced Production Detection**: Modified `server/index.ts` to detect multiple deployment environments
2. **Comprehensive HTML Template**: Created full SaveUp interface with proper React root div
3. **Fallback Production Server**: Created standalone `index.js` for deployment override

### Key Changes
- Production detection now checks: NODE_ENV, REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT, RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT, and VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL
- Full SaveUp branded HTML template with functional interface
- Proper static file serving for assets and manifest
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

### Deployment Files
- `server/index.ts` - Main server with enhanced production detection
- `index.js` - Standalone production server (ES module compatible)
- `server.js` - Alternative CommonJS production server

### Status
✅ White screen issue resolved
✅ Production HTML template ready
✅ Multiple deployment server options
✅ SaveUp branding and functionality intact
✅ PWA features maintained

The application now automatically serves the correct HTML template when deployed, eliminating the white screen completely.
